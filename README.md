# 💀 Skeleton Protocol: Rescuing AI from Code Debt

A tactical framework designed to combat "Context Poverty" and "Logical Drift" in AI-assisted software engineering.

## 🎯 The Core Challenge
As AI models increasingly handle large-scale refactoring, three critical issues emerge:
* **Code Bloat**: Redundant logic generated by models that prioritize token count over architectural purity.
* **Context Poverty**: The model's inability to grasp global dependencies in complex codebases.
* **Knowledge Erosion**: The loss of granular control over core logic during massive AI-led rewrites.

## 🛠️ The Solution: Skeleton Protocol
The **Skeleton Protocol** mandates a "Bone-First" approach to AI collaboration:

1. **Schema-First Anchoring**: Define immutable core interfaces and data structures (the "Bones") before allowing the AI to generate implementation logic.
2. **Context Anchors**: Strategic placement of persistent metadata within the codebase to guide AI focus and maintain cross-module consistency.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Moving away from "one-shot" refactoring in favor of modular, bone-by-bone reconstruction.

## 💻 Practical Implementation (The "Bones" Method)

Here is how to apply the Skeleton Protocol to a legacy script refactoring task:

### Phase 1: Define the Skeleton (The Bones)
Do NOT ask the AI to "fix the script." Instead, provide the **Immutable Schema** first:

```bash
# SKELETON_START
# Core Interface: Any push service MUST follow this structure
# 1. Load Environment Variables
# 2. Validate Token/ID
# 3. Execute POST Request via curl
# SKELETON_END
```

### Phase 2: Implementation via Anchors
Guide the AI to fill the "flesh" without breaking the "bones":

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# [ANCHOR: ENV_LOADER]
TOKEN="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
CHAT_ID="YOUR_CHAT_ID"

# [ANCHOR: LOGIC_CORE]
# AI is instructed to ONLY modify the curl parameters here
curl -s -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TOKEN/sendMessage" \
     -d chat_id="$CHAT_ID" \
     -d text="$1"
```

*By defining the **Skeleton** and **Anchors**, you prevent the AI from introducing "Code Bloat" or losing the "Context" of your specific server environment.*

# 💀 Skeleton Protocol: Rescuing AI from Code Debt

A tactical framework designed to combat "Context Poverty" and "Logical Drift" in AI-assisted software engineering.

## 🎯 The Core Challenge
As AI models increasingly handle large-scale refactoring, three critical issues emerge:
* **Code Bloat**: Redundant logic generated by models that prioritize token count over architectural purity.
* **Context Poverty**: The model's inability to grasp global dependencies in complex codebases.
* **Knowledge Erosion**: The loss of granular control over core logic during massive AI-led rewrites.

## 🛠️ The Solution: Skeleton Protocol
The **Skeleton Protocol** mandates a "Bone-First" approach to AI collaboration:

1. **Schema-First Anchoring**: Define immutable core interfaces and data structures (the "Bones") before allowing the AI to generate implementation logic.
2. **Context Anchors**: Strategic placement of persistent metadata within the codebase to guide AI focus and maintain cross-module consistency.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Moving away from "one-shot" refactoring in favor of modular, bone-by-bone reconstruction.
